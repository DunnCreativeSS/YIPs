## Simple Summary
<!--"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Provide a simplified and layman-accessible explanation of the YIP.-->
Add a new Opportunity for the ETH portfolios - the Uniswap ETH/WETH liquidity pool.

## Abstract
<!--A short (~200 word) description of the technical issue being addressed.-->
RAY strives to earn the best passive yield possible on assets supported. Adding this Opportunity will help do that for the ETH asset.

## Motivation
<!--The motivation is critical for YIPs that want to change the RAY protocol. It should clearly explain why the existing protocol specification is inadequate to address the problem that the YIP solves. YIP submissions without sufficient motivation may be rejected outright.-->
Adding this Opportunity will potentially boost ETH yields that RAY can generate, as well as generally give RAY more options to consider, while it fits the passive yield framework. 

## Specification
<!--The technical specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature.-->

## Rationale
<!--The rationale fleshes out the specification by describing what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related work, e.g. how the feature is supported in other languages. The rationale may also provide evidence of consensus within the community, and should discuss important objections or concerns raised during discussion.-->

## Backwards Compatibility
<!--All YIPs that introduce backwards incompatibilities must include a section describing these incompatibilities and their severity. The YIP must explain how the author proposes to deal with these incompatibilities. YIP submissions without a sufficient backwards compatibility treatise may be rejected outright.-->
This YIP is fully backwards compatible.

## Test Cases
<!--Test cases for an implementation are mandatory for YIPs that are affecting consensus changes. Other YIPs can choose to include links to test cases if applicable.-->

## Implementation
<!--The implementations must be completed before any YIP is given status "Final", but it need not be completed before the YIP is accepted. While there is merit to the approach of reaching consensus on the specification and rationale before writing code, the principle of "rough consensus and running code" is still useful when it comes to resolving many discussions of API details.-->

## Security Considerations
<!--All YIPs must contain a section that discusses the security implications/considerations relevant to the proposed change. Include information that might be important for security discussions, surfaces risks and can be used throughout the life cycle of the proposal. E.g. include security-relevant design decisions, concerns, important discussions, implementation-specific guidance and pitfalls, an outline of threats and risks and how they are being addressed. YIP submissions missing the "Security Considerations" section will be rejected. An YIP cannot proceed to status "Final" without a Security Considerations discussion deemed sufficient by the reviewers.-->
